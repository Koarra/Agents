CLIENT DUE DILIGENCE REPORT - Global Trade Facilitators LLC

Client Name: Global Trade Facilitators LLC
Business Type: Import/Export Consulting
Date: January 18, 2024

Business Overview:
Global Trade Facilitators is an import/export consulting firm established in 2022. The company claims to facilitate international trade transactions between various countries. The business structure is relatively opaque with multiple layers of subsidiary companies registered in Delaware, the British Virgin Islands, and Panama.

Financial Profile:
The client reports annual revenues of approximately $12 million, but the transaction patterns are unusual. Large cash deposits are frequently made into the business account, often in amounts just below $10,000. The stated business purpose involves "consulting fees" but detailed invoicing is often vague or missing. Funds typically move through the account rapidly, with money coming in and going out to various offshore accounts within days.

Transaction Patterns:
Over the past six months, the company has executed over 200 wire transfers to accounts in various countries including the Cayman Islands, Cyprus, and Hong Kong. The business justification for these transactions is often unclear. Multiple instances of funds being transferred to seemingly unrelated third parties without clear business documentation. Several transactions involve complex chains where money is moved through multiple intermediary accounts.

Ownership Structure:
The ownership structure is difficult to verify. The company is nominally owned by Horizon Holdings Trust, registered in the British Virgin Islands. Beneficial ownership information is not readily available. The company representative, Mr. James Wilson, has been reluctant to provide detailed ownership documentation despite multiple requests.

Banking Relationships:
The client maintains accounts at three different banks and frequently transfers funds between these accounts. Account activity shows unusual patterns including frequent round-number transactions and rapid movement of large sums. The company also mentions using cryptocurrency exchanges for certain international transactions.

Documentation Concerns:
Supporting documentation for business activities is often incomplete or generic. Contracts lack specific details about goods or services provided.
