      "2. **Lack of directness**: By providing multiple steps, you've introduced unnecessary complexity. This format is better suited for problem-solving or critical thinking questions that require a more in-depth approach.\n",
      "3. **Too much background information**: While it's great to know the history behind Canberra being designated as the capital, this level of detail is not necessary for answering the question directly.\n",
      "4. **Omitting essential information**: The response doesn't explicitly state that Sydney is not the capital (which might be a common mistake) and that Canberra is indeed the correct answer.\n",

      "1. Answer directly: Stick to the format of simply stating \"Canberra\" as the response to the original question.\n",

      "Here's a step-by-step explanation of the concept of entropy in thermodynamics:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is Entropy?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Entropy (S) is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. It describes the amount of thermal energy unavailable to do work in a system. In other words, it measures how dispersed energy is within a system.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Irreversibility**: Entropy always increases over time in an isolated system (i.e., one that does not exchange matter or energy with its surroundings). This means that the disorder of a system will never decrease on its own.\n",
      "2. **Unpredictability**: The behavior of a system becomes more unpredictable as entropy increases. As energy is transferred from one part of the system to another, the system's behavior becomes less organized and more random.\n",
      "3. **Equilibrium**: When a system reaches equilibrium, it has maximum entropy. This means that there are no longer any significant gradients or differences in temperature, concentration, or other properties within the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Examples:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Spilling Coffee**: Imagine you spill coffee on your tablecloth. As the liquid spreads out and mixes with the surrounding cloth, its disorder increases (more random arrangement of molecules), leading to an increase in entropy.\n",
      "2. **Heat Transfer**: When a hot cup of water is placed in a cold room, heat flows from the water to the surroundings until they reach thermal equilibrium. During this process, the entropy of the system (water + surroundings) increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Mathematical Representation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Entropy can be calculated using the following equation:\n",
      "\n",
      "ŒîS = Q / T\n",
      "\n",
      "where:\n",
      "- ŒîS is the change in entropy\n",
      "- Q is the amount of heat transferred to or from a system\n",
      "- T is the temperature at which the heat transfer occurs (in Kelvin)\n",
      "\n",
      "The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system always increases over time. This fundamental principle has far-reaching implications for various fields, including engineering, chemistry, and biology.\n",
